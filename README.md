Snippet API – A Django REST Framework Project
This project is a simple yet robust web API built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It provides an organized and scalable backend for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) code snippets. Whether you're building a code-sharing platform, a documentation site, or just learning how REST APIs work in Django, this project serves as a solid starting point.

The main focus of this API is to manage code snippets through a clean REST interface. It includes core components such as serializers, views, models, and utility functions — all structured within a Django app. In addition, it leverages Django’s powerful admin interface to allow admins or developers to manage snippet entries through a user-friendly web panel.

To get the project running on your local machine, first clone the repository and navigate into the project directory. You should create a virtual environment using python -m venv venv and activate it. Once activated, install the required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.

Next, you’ll need to apply migrations using python manage.py migrate to set up your database schema. After that, create a superuser with python manage.py createsuperuser so you can access the admin interface. With these steps complete, run the development server using python manage.py runserver.

Once the server is running, the API endpoints will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/snippets/, where you can list, create, update, and delete code snippets. If you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/, you'll find the Django admin dashboard, where you can manage all registered models, including your snippets, with ease.

This project is intentionally kept simple and modular so that developers can understand the flow of a Django API from database model to URL routing and REST response. It also includes a utils.py file that contains helper functions to keep views clean and maintainable.

While authentication is not enforced by default, this project can easily be extended with Django REST Framework’s authentication features such as token auth, session auth, or JWT, depending on your use case.

Feel free to fork this project, open issues, or submit pull requests. It's licensed under the MIT License, so you're welcome to use and modify it for personal or commercial projects. This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to build their own API using Django.
